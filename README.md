# Claude Code Workflows

A collection of reusable workflow templates for common development and educational projects. These workflows provide consistent, high-quality project creation with built-in best practices.

## üöÄ Available Workflows

### 1. Tutorial Repository Creation
**File**: [`tutorial-repo-workflow.md`](./tutorial-repo-workflow.md)  
**Purpose**: Create educational/course material repositories  
**Best For**: Tutorials, prompts, educational tools, course materials  
**Output**: Documentation-heavy repos with immediate usability  

### 2. Code Project Creation
**File**: [`code-project-workflow.md`](./code-project-workflow.md)  
**Purpose**: Create production-ready code projects  
**Best For**: Applications, APIs, tools, libraries  
**Output**: Structured codebases with testing and deployment ready  

## üìñ How to Use These Workflows

### Step 1: Choose Your Workflow
- **Educational content?** ‚Üí Use Tutorial Repository workflow
- **Code project?** ‚Üí Use Code Project workflow

### Step 2: Reference in Claude Code
Copy the relevant workflow content and paste it into your Claude Code session, then say:
- "Follow the tutorial repo workflow to create [your project]"
- "Use the code project workflow for a [technology] project"

### Step 3: Let Claude Execute
Claude will:
1. Set up TodoWrite with proper task tracking
2. Create the complete project structure
3. Generate all necessary files
4. Upload to GitHub ready to use

## üéØ Workflow Benefits

### Consistency
- Same high-quality structure every time
- Built-in best practices and conventions
- Predictable file organization

### Speed
- Skip repetitive setup tasks
- Automated directory creation
- Pre-configured tooling and dependencies

### Quality
- Comprehensive documentation included
- Testing frameworks set up
- Quality checks built in
- Production-ready configuration

### Educational Value
- Clear examples and patterns
- Best practice implementations
- Learning-oriented structure

## üîß Customization

Each workflow is a template that adapts to:
- **Technology choices**: React, Node.js, Python, etc.
- **Project complexity**: Simple scripts to complex applications
- **Specific requirements**: Custom features and integrations
- **Team preferences**: Coding standards and tooling choices

## üìù Workflow Components

### TodoWrite Templates
Each workflow includes pre-defined task lists that:
- Track progress systematically
- Ensure no steps are missed
- Provide clear completion criteria
- Enable parallel execution where possible

### File Structure Patterns
Proven directory structures for:
- Frontend applications (React, Next.js)
- Backend APIs (Node.js, Python)
- Full-stack applications
- Educational content repositories

### Configuration Templates
Ready-to-use config files:
- `package.json` with proper scripts
- Environment variable templates
- Testing framework setup
- Linting and formatting rules
- Build and deployment configuration

### Quality Gates
Built-in checkpoints:
- Code quality validation
- Test execution
- Build verification
- Documentation completeness
- Deployment readiness

## üé® Example Usage

### Creating a Tutorial Repository
```
User: "I need to create a tutorial about Supabase RLS for my students"

Claude: *References tutorial-repo-workflow.md*
1. Sets up TodoWrite with 5 main tasks
2. Creates main-content.md with RLS tutorial
3. Generates comprehensive README.md
4. Uploads to GitHub ready for students
```

### Creating a Code Project
```
User: "Build a React app with TypeScript and Tailwind"

Claude: *References code-project-workflow.md*
1. Sets up TodoWrite with 8 development tasks
2. Creates React project structure
3. Configures TypeScript and Tailwind
4. Adds testing setup and documentation
5. Deploys to GitHub ready for development
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Option 1: Copy-Paste Method
1. Open the workflow file you need
2. Copy the entire content
3. Paste into Claude Code session
4. Tell Claude what you want to create

### Option 2: Reference Method
1. Share the GitHub link to this repository with Claude
2. Ask Claude to read the specific workflow
3. Request project creation using that workflow

### Option 3: Clone and Reference
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/workflows.git
cd workflows
# Reference files directly in conversations
```

## üí° Best Practices for Using Workflows

### Before Starting
1. **Be Specific**: Clearly describe your project goals
2. **Choose Technology**: Mention preferred frameworks/languages
3. **Set Scope**: Define project complexity and features
4. **Share Context**: Provide any specific requirements

### During Execution
1. **Let Claude Follow Steps**: Don't skip workflow steps
2. **Review TodoWrite**: Check that all tasks are appropriate
3. **Customize as Needed**: Workflows adapt to your specific needs
4. **Test Everything**: Verify the output works as expected

### After Completion
1. **Verify Repository**: Check that it's complete and functional
2. **Test Locally**: Clone and run the project
3. **Share with Others**: Ensure it works for intended users
4. **Iterate**: Use feedback to improve future workflows

## üîÑ Workflow Evolution

These workflows improve over time through:
- **Real-world usage**: Refinements based on actual project creation
- **Technology updates**: New frameworks and best practices
- **Community feedback**: Suggestions from users
- **Pattern recognition**: Common requirements across projects
